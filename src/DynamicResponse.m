% DynamicResponse - Intended for use with VSPAero Stability Analysis,
% calculates the dynamic response of the aircraft given the required
% non-dimensional static derivatives and control derivatives. User selects
% a .stab file from VSPAero, and this code does the rest. See README for
% more details.

% Longitudinal Modes-------------------------------------------------------

% Calculate Characteristic Equation Roots
longRoots = LongitudinalRoots(allData);

% Calculate Phugoid Damping Ratio and Frequency
phugoidResults = PhugoidCalc(longRoots);

% Calculate Short Period Damping Ratio and Frequency

% Lateral Modes------------------------------------------------------------

% Calculate Characteristic Equation Roots
latRoots = LateralRoots(allData);

% Calculate Dutch Roll Damping Ratio and Frequency
dutchRollResults = DutchRollCalc(latRoots);

% Calculate Spiral Time to double amplitude
spiralResults = SpiralCalc(latRoots);

% Calculate Roll Mode Time Constant
rollTimeConstant = RollTimeConstantCalc(latRoots, allData); %Tr=1/Lp

% Calculate Roll Control Effectivness
rollControlEffectivness = RollControlEffectivnessCalc(latRoots, allData);
